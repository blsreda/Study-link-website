## ðŸš€ About Me
My name is B. Reda and I am a Junior Front End developer with a focus on front-end development.
I have a passion for creating user-friendly and visually
appealing websites, and I am constantly learning and
expanding my skillset in order to stay up-to-date with the latest trends
and technologies in the field. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new design
tools and techniques, as well as collaborating with other developers on open source
projects. I am always open to new opportunities and challenges, and I welcome the
chance to work with like-minded individuals who share my passion for building
innovative web experiences.
